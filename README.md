To extract meaningful insights, ```extensive data preprocessing was conducted, addressing missing values and outliers.Outliers, while sometimes indicative of data entry errors, often signal significant phenomena like viral content or trending topics, which can dramatically affect a channel's metrics. Visualizations were employed to better understand these trends and anomalies. The analysis aims to answer key questions about what drives success on YouTube, identifying patterns and correlations between different variables. ```

This analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations. These tools enabled efficient data preprocessing, handling missing values, identifying outliers, and generating visual representations of the dataset's key insights.
